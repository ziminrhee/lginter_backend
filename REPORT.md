## Audit
- **Events**: Legacy socket events such as `device-decision`, `new-name`, `new-user`, `new-voice-mobile`, and `mobile-user-needs` remain in use alongside the spec-required events in `pages/api/socket.js` and `utils/hooks/socketEvents.js`.
- **Rooms**: `pages/api/socket.js` still broadcasts some feedback with `io.emit(...)`, so mobile responses leak outside the `user:{id}` room and violate the spec’s routing rule.
- **Page Routes**: Legacy dashboards under `/lab/*` are still exposed in `pages/lab/`, which are outside the mandated `mobile`, `livingroom`, `entrance`, and `controller` surfaces.
- **File Tree**: Socket hooks and shared utilities are split between `src/*` and `utils/hooks/*`, so the ThinQ-related SSoT code is not yet centralized under `src/` as the new architecture expects.
- **Server Rules**: The Socket.IO hub in `pages/api/socket.js` still owns device arbitration logic and legacy shims, and the project keeps an unused `express` dependency.
- **TypeScript**: No `.ts`/`.tsx` sources detected in the repo (only dependency type definitions).

## Implementation Summary
- Added `src/utils/env.js` and `src/utils/logger.js` so ThinQ credentials stay in env-only scope with masked logging.
- Introduced `src/core/schemas.js` using Zod and a `pages/api/devices/[kind].js` proxy that enforces single-parameter posts.
- Implemented `src/services/thinq.service.js` and `src/services/deviceQueue.js` to serialize LG ThinQ calls with jittered delays and history snapshots.
- Extended the Socket.IO hub to hydrate controller state, queue device jobs from feelings/decisions, and broadcast `controller-device-status` updates.
- Upgraded `/controller` UI with a Device Actions panel (queue timeline, manual tests) and added Vitest coverage in `tests/thinq.spec.js` (`yarn test`).

## Connectivity Tests
Perform these two checks in a staging or lab environment and record results here once verified:
- ThinQ mobile app fully terminated (force quit) → trigger `/api/devices/airconditioner` and `/api/devices/airpurifierfan` from the Controller page; note whether appliances respond without the app running.
- ThinQ account logged out or app reinstalled → repeat the API proxy calls; confirm whether server-side credentials alone succeed. Document any prerequisite sign-in requirements or error codes observed.
